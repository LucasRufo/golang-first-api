# Golang First API

This project was my first API using Go, and it was developed following this [amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyEYpX5U4Vg) (in portuguese) by [@arthur404dev](https://github.com/arthur404dev).

It has CRUD operations for an entity called `Opportunity` and has swagger documentation using the [gin-swagger package](https://github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger).

Coming from a .NET background, my first impressions are that Go is a little more verbose and doesn't have the simplicity that .NET has to create APIs. I'm not familiar with the Go environment yet, so I know that there are probably a lot of things that can be done in an easier way when creating an API.

I will still be learning Go and creating little projects to have a better opinion, but overall, it's really fun to use a language that I'm not used to, and I feel that this can make me better at using C# and feel comfortable learning different languages if needed.
